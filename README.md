# The-2022-Pack
Curse Forge export of a hand-picked collection of mods for Minecraft `1.12.2`

## Installation

requires: `Minecraft` `Curse Forge Launcher`

- In the **Minecraft** section in CurseForge, select the `Create Custom Profile`, then `import` in the popup.

- Select the `*.zip` to import the profile. ( *There is no need to decompress the directory.* )

That's it!

## Mod Updates

For those downloading the pack to join the server... please don't update any mods ( unless they're client only mods you've added, such as `FastCraft` ) as this will make your version incompatable with the server.
