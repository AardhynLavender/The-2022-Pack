# The-2022-Pack
Curse Forge export of a hand-picked collection of Minecraft mods for a private server

## Installation

requires: `Minecraft` `Curse Forge Launcher`

In the Minecraft section of CurseForge, select the `Create Custom Profile` and then `import` in the popup. Select the `.zip` to import the profile--*there is no need to decompress the directory.*

That's it!

## Mod Updates

For those downloading the pack to join the server... please dont update any mods as this will make your version incompatable with the servers copy.
